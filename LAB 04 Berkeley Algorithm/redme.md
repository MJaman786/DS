# ‚è∞ Berkeley Algorithm - Clock Synchronization (Java)

This is a simple Java implementation of the **Berkeley Algorithm** for clock synchronization in distributed systems. The master (server) node calculates the average time from all clients and synchronizes them accordingly.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

In a distributed system, clocks on different machines may not be synchronized. The **Berkeley Algorithm** is used to synchronize time among all nodes (including the master), using averaging.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Clients** send their current local time to the **server**.
2. **Server** receives all times and calculates the **average time**.
3. Server sends the **synchronized time** back to all clients.
